# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong using the Turtle module in Python.

## Key Features

- **Game Setup**: The game window, players, ball, and scoring system are set up appropriately.
- **Player Controls**: Keyboard controls allow both players to move their paddles up and down.
- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves diagonally and bounces off walls and paddles correctly.
- **Scoring**: A scoring system keeps track of each player's score, with the game ending when one player reaches the target score.
- **Game Over**: When the game ends, the ball stops moving, and the winner is announced.
- **Boundary Checks**: Boundary checks prevent the ball from moving beyond the top and bottom lines.

## Usage

## Controls
